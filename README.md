# Mars-Web-Scraping-Analysis
Uses beautiful soup to scrape Mars data and flask to relay that data to a dashboard.

Mission_to_mars.ipynb uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the data and put it into a dictionary. App.py and index.html relay that data onto the site. Run app.py to get the flask server to work.
